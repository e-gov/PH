# Specification draft

There are two ways to integrate with Pääsuke:
1) integrator keeps mandates on their side and Pääsuke queries X-Road services [offered to Pääsuke](#x-road-services-offered-to-p%C3%A4%C3%A4suke) by the integrator
2) integrator keeps mandates in Pääsuke and the integrator queries X-Road services [offered by Pääsuke](#x-road-services-offered-by-p%C3%A4%C3%A4suke).

### Sample provider application
