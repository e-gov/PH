Then invisible roles can be used to carry this property.</p> <p><b>assignableOnlyIfRepresenteeHasRoleIn</b> - If this configuration parameter has a value then the check is done in addition to the assignableBy check (delegate must have a role in the assignableBy list). <br/>Defining this list is used in rare cases (like eesti.ee RR partner services) where in order to assign the role, the <u>representee</u> also must have at least one role in this list.</p> <p><b>delegateCanEqualToRepresentee  </b> - If this is set to true then in the admin portal (MISP2) it is possible to create mandates with this role where the value of representee equals to the value of delegate.
